# Decentralized Asteroid Mining Investment Platform

A blockchain-based platform enabling distributed investment in asteroid mining operations through tokenized shares and transparent resource allocation.

## Overview

This platform leverages Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to create a decentralized investment ecosystem for asteroid mining ventures. Investors can purchase mining shares representing fractional ownership in mining operations, while automated resource allocation ensures transparent distribution of mined resources.

## Architecture

The platform consists of two core smart contracts:

### Mining Shares Contract (`mining-shares.clar`)
- **Fungible Token System**: Implements a share-based token representing fractional ownership in mining operations
- **Investment Management**: Handles investor registration, share issuance, and investment tracking
- **Dividend Distribution**: Automated payout system distributing mining profits to shareholders
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for mining operators and administrators

### Resource Allocator Contract (`resource-allocator.clar`)
- **Resource Tracking**: Maintains inventory of mined resources (metals, minerals, rare earth elements)
- **Allocation Proposals**: Democratic voting system for resource distribution decisions
- **Settlement Engine**: Automated execution of approved allocation proposals
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable record of all resource movements and decisions

## Key Features

- **Transparent Investments**: All share transactions and holdings publicly verifiable on-chain
- **Automated Dividends**: Smart contract-based profit distribution based on shareholding percentages
- **Democratic Resource Allocation**: Shareholders vote on resource distribution proposals
- **Immutable Records**: Complete audit trail of all mining operations and financial transactions
- **Secure Multi-sig Operations**: Critical functions require multi-party approval
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live updates on mining progress and resource yields

## Smart Contract Functions

### Mining Shares
- `buy-shares`: Purchase mining shares with STX tokens
- `transfer-shares`: Transfer shares between addresses
- `claim-dividends`: Claim accumulated dividend payouts
- `get-shareholding`: Query individual shareholding information
- `distribute-profits`: Operator function to distribute mining profits

### Resource Allocator  
- `register-resource`: Log newly mined resources into the system
- `propose-allocation`: Submit resource allocation proposal for voting
- `vote-on-proposal`: Shareholders vote on active proposals
- `execute-allocation`: Execute approved allocation proposals
- `get-resource-inventory`: Query current resource holdings

## Development Workflow

1. **Project Initialization**: Clarinet project setup with contract scaffolding
2. **Smart Contract Development**: Implementation of core mining shares and resource allocation logic
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for all contract functions
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of contract interactions
5. **Deployment**: Mainnet deployment with proper configuration
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of contract operations and resource flows

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks Layer-1 blockchain
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity programming language
- **Development Framework**: Clarinet for local development and testing
- **Frontend Integration**: Web3 integration for user interfaces
- **Security**: Multi-signature requirements and role-based access control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) - Stacks smart contract development tool
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - For testing and integration
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet) - For interacting with deployed contracts

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anitadaniel385/decentralized-asteroid-mining-investment-platform.git
cd decentralized-asteroid-mining-investment-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run contract syntax check
clarinet check

# Execute test suite
clarinet test
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Start local blockchain
clarinet integrate

# Deploy contracts locally
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/enhancement`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/enhancement`)
5. Create a Pull Request

## Security Considerations

- All critical functions require proper authorization checks
- Multi-signature requirements for high-value operations  
- Rate limiting on share purchases to prevent market manipulation
- Emergency pause functionality for contract upgrades
- Regular security audits and formal verification

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core contract deployment and basic functionality
- **Phase 2**: Advanced voting mechanisms and proposal types
- **Phase 3**: Integration with real-world mining data feeds
- **Phase 4**: Cross-chain compatibility and additional asset support
- **Phase 5**: AI-powered resource allocation optimization
